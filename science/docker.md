# 什么是倒客/What is Docker?

倒客（私人所译“Docker”中文名）是一个用于开发、发布和运行应用程序的开放平台。它能让你把应用程序从基础设施的复杂中解放出来，从而进行快速交付。在倒客里，可以像管理应用程序一样来管理基础设施。利用倒客可以快速交付、测试、部署的优点，你可以显著缩短代码开发到生产环境运行的周期。

Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Docker’s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.
